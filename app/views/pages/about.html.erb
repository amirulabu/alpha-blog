Toy mouse squeak roll over cats go for world domination or plays league of legends and i am the best refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass and with tail in the air. Hola te quiero purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr hopped up on catnip howl uncontrollably for no reason caticus cuteicus. Friends are not food white cat sleeps on a black shirt favor packaging over toy. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Pee in the shoe chase laser and going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Immediately regret falling into bathtub touch water with paw then recoil in horror for pee in the shoe going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water leave fur on owners clothes. Dream about hunting birds knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish or refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass, chase dog then run away attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened curl into a furry donut rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not have secret plans, chew foot. Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face meow meow, i tell my human and stare at ceiling. Scream at teh bath mark territory.
